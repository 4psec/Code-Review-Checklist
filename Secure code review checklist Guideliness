While every codebase is unique and may have specific security considerations, here's a general checklist that can help guide your secure code review process:

Input Validation:

  Check if user input is properly validated to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.

Authentication and Authorization:

  Verify that authentication mechanisms are implemented correctly and user credentials are securely stored and transmitted.
  Ensure that authorization checks are in place to restrict access to sensitive functions and data.

Data Sanitization and Encoding:

  Check if user input and other data are sanitized and properly encoded when being displayed or stored to prevent data corruption and injection attacks.

Session Management:

  Evaluate the implementation of session management to ensure secure session handling, token management, and session expiration.

Error Handling and Logging:

  Review error handling mechanisms to avoid leaking sensitive information and ensure proper error logging for debugging and auditing purposes.

Cryptography:

  Check the usage of cryptographic functions and algorithms to ensure they are implemented correctly and securely.

Secure Communication:

  Verify that sensitive information is transmitted over secure channels (e.g., HTTPS) and that appropriate encryption is used for data in transit.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:

  Inspect the code for proper sanitization and encoding of user-generated content to prevent XSS attacks.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention:

  Check if measures are in place to protect against CSRF attacks, such as using anti-CSRF tokens and proper validation of requests.

Secure File Handling:

  Review file upload and download functionality to ensure secure file handling practices, including proper validation, sanitization, and secure storage.

Code Injection Prevention:

Check for vulnerabilities related to code injection attacks, such as ensuring user input is not executed as code or commands directly.

Third-Party Libraries and Dependencies:

  Assess the usage of third-party libraries and dependencies, ensuring they are up to date and free from known security vulnerabilities.

Secure Configuration:

  Review configuration files and settings to ensure secure configurations are applied, such as disabling unnecessary services and using strong passwords.

Security Headers and Best Practices:

  Check if security headers, such as Content Security Policy (CSP) and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), are properly implemented.

Documentation and Security Guidelines:

  Evaluate the presence of secure coding guidelines and documentation to ensure that developers follow best practices and security standards.
